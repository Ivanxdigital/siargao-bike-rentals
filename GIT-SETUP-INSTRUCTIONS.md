# Git Repository Setup Instructions

The local Git repository has been initialized. To connect it to a remote repository, follow these steps:

## Creating a Remote Repository

1. Go to GitHub (or your preferred Git hosting service)
2. Create a new repository named "siargao-bike-rentals" (or your preferred name)
3. **Do not** initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license

## Connecting Your Local Repository to the Remote

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your actual username
# Replace REPOSITORY_NAME with your repository name if different from "siargao-bike-rentals"

# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/siargao-bike-rentals.git

# Push your local repository to the remote
git push -u origin main
```

## Verifying the Connection

After pushing, verify that your remote repository contains all your files by visiting:
https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/siargao-bike-rentals

## Next Steps

Once your repository is properly set up, proceed with the development roadmap starting with the Supabase configuration and authentication setup.
